# TokenToSheet
A short but useful API with 2 handy uses:

1. Set up a character sheet for a token, and quickly populate the sheet with important information.
2. Duplicate a character sheet and quickly alter its information.

### Why Not Manually?
This API increses the speed of work tenfold when it comes to creating and editing tokens. Have you, or your GM, ever had an action packed moment slowed and stopped by token setup and organization? Experience that no more, when sheets can be created in a matter of seconds.

### Commands
#### The Only Command: `!tokensheet`
With a token selected, this command will do one of the following:

- Create a sheet for the token.
- Duplicate the sheet the token represents, naming the new sheet by the token's name.
- Show an array of buttons in the chat that can modify the current token and its sheet.
